File discription:
Please put the GPDD directory in the home folder of Linux to make sure some scripts can run properly.
You must have Flex, Bison and g++ to compile the program.
You may install ctags for tag.

**************************************************************

Src Folder:
All programs including GPDD source and parser.
allTest: a script for testing all the circuits in ./test/basic
tag: a script for testing 
TR.mdl: a file recording one typical output generated by allTest for comparison.

Test Folder:
clean.sh: a script for removing all outputs generating in the basic.
basic: a folder containing some test circuits. (You may also write your own test file, and put it anywhere.)
answer: a folder containing the correct results of those files in basic for comparison.

**************************************************************

README Rules:
{What you want to do}: 
	{Type in the command line}
	{Some extra information}

**************************************************************
In src file, you may do stuff below:
make & build: 
	make

clean: 
	make clean

run program without extra information: 
	./GPDD_hhb {Test Circuit File}
	Example for Test Circuit File: ./GPDD_hhb ../test/RC.cir

run program with other choice: 
	./GPDD_hhb {Test Circuit File} {Type Anything here}
	Example for other choice: ./GPDD_hhb ../test/RC.cir 0

test all circuits in File test: 
	./allTest 
	Only all test file which ends with '.cir' in ./test/basic
	Automatically compare with answer, output the difference between TR.mdl,
	Only some time & crash difference should be right.

get updated tags:
	./tag

**************************************************************
In test file, you may do stuff below:

compare the result in ./test/basic with the one in ./test/answer/:
	./compare.sh
	Only compare those output file that ends with '.out' with the same name

clean the output file in ./test/:
	./clean.sh
	Doesn't affect those in ./test/answer/

You are also encouraged to write your own circuit for test.
